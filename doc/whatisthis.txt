pgdiff aims to be a utility to show you differences between two database schemas.
It should help you mainly when doing upgrades of your application when your schema is filled with data.
It should automagicaly detect all the changes and issue appropriate CREATEs, DROPs and ALTERs to have your schema altered.
It should probably be named something else than pgdiff.
